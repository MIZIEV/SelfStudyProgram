Hello my friend =)
This is my first programm in Java.
I created it to improve my programming skills, and to demonstrate these same skills.
When creating the program, I used MVC pattern.

It is very simple, there are 400 question and answers on the topic of programming 
in mySQL database. In first window you chose the topic on witch you want to see the questions.
When you selected all the topics you need and press start button, my programm take all questions and 
answers from database and put they on array list. In second window you will see the questions you have
selected, if you know the answer, you can click on the green button and you will not see the question again.
